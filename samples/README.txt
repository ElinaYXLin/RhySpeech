These are the audios offered to participants for their MOS testing, except the testing version is shuffled and this one is not. File names 1~5 represent different texual prompts, and each number-to-text is consistent over the two models. The "RhySpeech" folder holds audio generated by the model designed by this research, and the "Baseline" folder holds that of Fastspeech 2 (baseline). Both models were trained for 10000 steps with the same batch size. Note that the RhySpeech model has less parameters than the Fastspeech2 one.
